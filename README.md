# __python Text Encrypter__

__PyVersion - 2__

There are libraries available to encrypt and decrypt text/data but the whole 
purpose of making this app is to know and understand the working process behind.

I used AES encryption to encrypt data(text) and __wx__ library as __UI__

The Button are commented but you can add them by using your own suitable icons
